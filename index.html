  <h1 class="h1">INTRODUCTION</h1>
  <p class="p1">My name is Prince Kumar, a student of Class 8 at Trivia Concept School, located near the Main Road, where I continue to explore my passion for learning and growth. I reside in Noorsarai, a town in the Nalanda district of Bihar, a place that has deeply shaped my journey.

   </div>
   <p class="P P2">In March 2016, at the age of 6 or 7, my life took a new turn as I moved to Noorsarai, leaving behind memories of my early years in Chhattisgarh. It was the town where my journey into education began at Saraswati Sishu Mandir School.The Place was may called Korba Where I used to live. I literally have  a negligible memory of my childhood of chattisgarh.</p>

   </div>
   <p class="P P3">From an early age, I’ve always been drawn to the excitement of video games on my mobile, where virtual worlds come to life in the palm of my hand. Beyond gaming, my curiosity constantly pushes me to learn about new things, whether it's the latest technology or a fascinating concept. One of my greatest joys, however, comes with the rains— something magical about the monsoon season that fills me with a sense of peace and wonder.</p>
